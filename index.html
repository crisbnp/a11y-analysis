      <h2>Motivation to analyse this <a href="https://kemlu.go.id/london/en" target="_blank">website</a>
      </h2>
      <p><p>
        As an Indonesian who lives abroad in the UK, I do go to the website when I need to renew passport or find relevant information. As it is a government website, I would expect an accessible website that caters towards all users. Unfortunately, I find it difficult to navigate the website as the hierachy of website is not clear and there are a lot of moving content which is hard to follow.

      <h2>Accessibility Review plan:</h2>
      <p>I want to make sure the website is accessible for users who rely heavily on keyboard to navigate by choice or otherwise. Users with motor impairments such as RSI or paralysis as well as screen readers.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ðŸ“Œ Check if it has a logical tab order and visible focus styles</li>
        <li>ðŸ“Œ Using screen reader - use VoiceOver built in Mac</li>
        <li>ðŸ“Œ Link and buttons should tell us what it is for and its state.</li>
      </ul>
